# ABOUT THIS PROJECT


Our philosophy is to provide education reliably and at low-cost like a water supply. We call this our “Water Supply Education Philosophy”. We will practice this philosophy on a global scale and create a society where all people on the planet can live happily and easily.
We will build a worldwide educational platform and ecosystem based on the achievements and knowledge that we gained from developing an educational platform in Japan.
It is a development project that recruits project participants from around the world and shares benefits with all participants.
The Water Supply Philosophy is the management philosophy advocated by Matsushita Konosuke, founder of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. (present Panasonic) in Japan. Japan has a long history of emphasizing the improvement of the water supply, and in the 1880s the penetration rate exceeded 90%. The Water Supply Philosophy means “to lower the price and difficulty for consumers to obtain something by supplying large quantities of high quality goods at low prices, like water from the tap.
